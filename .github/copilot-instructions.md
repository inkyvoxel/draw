# Copilot Instructions

- Use British English for all comments, documentation, and user-facing text (including labels, buttons, and messages).
- Use American English spelling for all variable names and function names in code.
- Add a clear, descriptive comment above every new method, stating its purpose.
- Use JSDoc style comments for all methods, including parameter and return type annotations.
- Use consistent comment styles: JSDoc `/** */` for method documentation and `//` for inline comments.
- Ensure comments are up-to-date and accurately reflect the code's functionality.
- Follow Clean Code principles. Adhere to the existing code style and naming conventions in this project.
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles where appropriate.
- Write concise, unambiguous instructions and avoid redundancy in comments and documentation.
- Ensure all code and documentation is consistent with the rest of the project.
- Ensure the `README.md` file is up to date when changes are made to features or functionality.
- When verifying JavaScript code, use `node -c <filename>` to check for syntax errors.
- When verifying the app is working, open the file directly in a web browser to test functionality. No need to run a server to serve the static files.
